arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

arr.delete_at(1)  => returns [1,3,4,5] as it deletes the item at index position 1 ie, the 2
arr.delete(1) => returns [2,3,4,5] as it just deletes the number 1 from the array.

# After reading the answer I realise my answer detailed  the revised arr array and not what was actually returned
