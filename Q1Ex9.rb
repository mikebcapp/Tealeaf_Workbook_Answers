# The question asks 'Given our earlier hash' ... However, I don't think there has been any previous discussion involving a hash?
# The previous question involved an array using the Flintstone characters adn this hash has Flinstone characters ... confused?

# Also I couldn't work this answer out.  I googled "turn hash to array" and never came across .assoc method.
# Willl finish this question tomorrow as its 3:30am and I need to go back to sleep :-)
